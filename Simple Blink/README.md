# Functionality
The main function of these programs is to demonstrate the use and implementation of a simple LED blink microprocessors. Using the MSP430G2553 microprocessor, we were able to toggle the LED when through implementing the code written in order to control the state of the LED.
# Valid INputs/Ouputs
In order to successfully understand this program, for the MSP430G2553 port 1.0 is configured to an LED
# Description of Code
The code works while within the infinite while loop port 1.0, which is the LED, is consisting being toggle during the duration of the delay.
